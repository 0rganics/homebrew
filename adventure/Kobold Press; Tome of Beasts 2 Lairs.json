								"Kolchak Counting House and Repository was a respected and venerable bank, a fixture among merchants and the wealthy in the city for many years.

The bank's director, Maxim Kolchak, was also the cult's high priest. A fire ten years ago damaged much of the building's upper story. It also covered an attack by an adventuring band that struck at the cult, killing Kolchak and many of the cultists.",

Neither group managed to retrieve the master coin of the greed swarm (see {@area Area 12|ttat12|x}), the guardian of the cult's secret vault, which has lain inert in the basement vault for a decade. Meanwhile, the damaged building sat unused, unowned, and boarded up\u2014until recently.",
								"Several weeks ago, a lone valkruung entered the city, seeking a new home after losing the rest of its group. While exploring its new home, it discovered the hidden shrine to Mammon in the basement. The basement's vault held the master coin of a greed swarm, forgotten by the cultists and overlooked by the adventurers who assaulted the shrine. The coin was powerless, long bereft of any valuables with which to form a swarm, at least until the valkruung began storing its stolen goods nearby. With a new supply of coins and valuables, the greed swarm reconstituted. The valkruung is delighted with its new companion, treating it as a shiny, jingly pet. The greed swarm and the valkruung venture out at night, and the two steal what they can from the local populace before retreating to Kolchak's ahead of the coming dawn.",

However, after the greed swarm reconstituted, the robberies increased in frequency and value, attracting more attention.",

Nafresi allowed them to found their temple in exchange for regular meals, preferably humanoid. The deathweaver appreciates having allied creatures nearby to act as a buffer against intruders and, as long as the tribute continues, she upholds her part of the deal by sending her web zombies to aid the ghouls."

								"Twenty years ago, the dwarves started a mining operation and colony, called Thyrdun, on the outer reaches of their domain. A few years later, the tailings dam accidentally ruptured, filling the mine with water and mud and causing collapses that trapped those who survived the flooding. The remaining colonists eventually ran out of air, dying a slow death in the darkness of the mine's depths. This tragic mass death spawned an overshadow (see {@area 9|tato9|u}), a terrible undead abomination formed of the fearful, hopeless souls who perished in the accident. The creature has dwelled in the dark, flooded, and collapsed mine ever since.",
								"Recently the dwarven leaders decided it was time to reopen Thyrdun, and they sent a new group of colonists to excavate and reopen the mine. The colonists repaired the dam, then built and refurbished equipment to pump the water out of the mine and back into the holding pond. Afterwards, they toiled to excavate the rooms of sediment and collapsed stone. Eventually, they opened the chamber where the overshadow waited. It was hungry but eager to make its new prey last. It took them slowly at first, building their fear and panic before finishing off the remaining survivors. Now Thyrdun has once again gone silent. Messengers to the outpost have failed to return, and the dwarven rulers urgently desire answers.",

They are charged with investigating the site, with the promise of their freedom if they accept the mission and discover the fate of the mine and its colony."

Most\u2014storage sheds, smelters, ore breakers\u2014are long unused, as the immediate task for the colony was to pump water out of the mine, excavate the collapsed areas, and assess stability. Nearby is a newly repaired earthen rampart of the tailings pond. Pipes lead from mine shafts to the pond.",
								"A circle of tents and a few permanent wooden structures nearby mark the site of the current colony. However, a search of the camp reveals no one. The provisions and personal belongings that remain indicate that any survivors left in a hurry, taking no time to pack. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception} or {@skill Survival}) check shows signs of disturbance in the camp. Some of the beds look as if someone was dragged from them. Success on such a check also notes the remains of numerous campfires\u2014more than would be needed for the numbers present here\u2014as well as a number of lanterns hanging on buildings or sitting near tents, all empty of oil, as if left burning, and mounds of dried wax and burned-out candle stubs. These are the result of the colonists' failed attempt at keeping the overshadow at bay using light.",
								"The entrance to the mine contains an elevator that is raised and lowered via a series of pulleys. A turnstile nearby has a harness sized for a beast of burden, such as a draft horse or an ox, but there is no animal to be seen. The PCs must bring the elevator up by hand, a process that takes 5 rounds. A successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check halves this time. To descend, someone must be on the surface to operate the turnstile, or else there are hand cranks in the elevator itself to lower it. These work more slowly, taking 10 rounds to lower the elevator to {@area 1|tato1|u}.",
