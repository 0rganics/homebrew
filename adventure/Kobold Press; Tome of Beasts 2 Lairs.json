								"Kolchak Counting House and Repository was a respected and venerable bank, a fixture among merchants and the wealthy in the city for many years. It was also the front for a cult of Mammon, which laundered its own ill-gotten gains through legal financial transactions made by the bank. The bank’s director, Maxim Kolchak, was also the cult’s high priest. A fire ten years ago damaged much of the building’s upper story. It also covered an attack by an adventuring band that struck at the cult, killing Kolchak and many of the cultists.",
								"The surviving cultists fled with what wealth they could, and the adventurers made off with the rest. Neither group managed to retrieve the master coin of the greed swarm (see {@area Area 12|ttat12|x}), the guardian of the cult’s secret vault, which has lain inert in the basement vault for a decade. Meanwhile, the damaged building sat unused, unowned, and boarded up—until recently.",
								"Several weeks ago, a lone valkruung entered the city, seeking a new home after losing the rest of its group. While exploring its new home, it discovered the hidden shrine to Mammon in the basement. The basement’s vault held the master coin of a greed swarm, forgotten by the cultists and overlooked by the adventurers who assaulted the shrine. The coin was powerless, long bereft of any valuables with which to form a swarm, at least until the valkruung began storing its stolen goods nearby. With a new supply of coins and valuables, the greed swarm reconstituted. The valkruung is delighted with its new companion, treating it as a shiny, jingly pet. The greed swarm and the valkruung venture out at night, and the two steal what they can from the local populace before retreating to Kolchak’s ahead of the coming dawn.",
								"As typical for its kind, the valkruung lurks on the rooftops, descending to steal from the populace. It takes anything that catches its fancy. As the creature engages in mostly petty thefts, often stealing things of little to no value, its activities didn’t garner much attention from the local watch. However, after the greed swarm reconstituted, the robberies increased in frequency and value, attracting more attention.",
								"The valkruung’s depredations, while constant, weren’t as concerning given the creature’s tendency to steal anything that piques its interests, valuable or not. The greed swarm is much more selective and has killed three people so far, catching them alone and making off with the valuables they carried.
