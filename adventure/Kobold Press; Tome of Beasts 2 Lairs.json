								"Kolchak Counting House and Repository was a respected and venerable bank, a fixture among merchants and the wealthy in the city for many years.

The bank's director, Maxim Kolchak, was also the cult's high priest. A fire ten years ago damaged much of the building's upper story. It also covered an attack by an adventuring band that struck at the cult, killing Kolchak and many of the cultists.",

Neither group managed to retrieve the master coin of the greed swarm (see {@area Area 12|ttat12|x}), the guardian of the cult's secret vault, which has lain inert in the basement vault for a decade. Meanwhile, the damaged building sat unused, unowned, and boarded up—until recently.",
								"Several weeks ago, a lone valkruung entered the city, seeking a new home after losing the rest of its group. While exploring its new home, it discovered the hidden shrine to Mammon in the basement. The basement's vault held the master coin of a greed swarm, forgotten by the cultists and overlooked by the adventurers who assaulted the shrine. The coin was powerless, long bereft of any valuables with which to form a swarm, at least until the valkruung began storing its stolen goods nearby. With a new supply of coins and valuables, the greed swarm reconstituted. The valkruung is delighted with its new companion, treating it as a shiny, jingly pet. The greed swarm and the valkruung venture out at night, and the two steal what they can from the local populace before retreating to Kolchak's ahead of the coming dawn.",

However, after the greed swarm reconstituted, the robberies increased in frequency and value, attracting more attention.",

The digging undermined a section of wall on one of the buildings, causing a partial collapse and disturbing a pestilence swarm, the original bearers of the disease that killed the fort's inhabitants. The swarm, its cozy shelter now exposed to daylight, flew off. The pestilence swarm eventually attacked a nearby village (see {@area Pestilence Descends|tffpd|x}). Meanwhile, the crocotta and its hyena allies settled into their new home.",
