You are free to modify the prices as you will, just be sure to tell your players that you are doing so in advance to the game start.",

										"Summoning Items are items that summon creatures to kill things or solve problems for you.",
										"Gamechanging Items are items that can have major effects on the way the players engage with the world or that can resculpt the campaign world in some major way all on their own.
