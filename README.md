2. Click "Raw" (top-right) and save it as .json

Getting help:

- Join the [5etools Discord Server](https://discord.gg/v3AXzcW) and ask in the #homebrew channel.

Creating and Contributing:

- The easiest way to make your own, is to copy one of the existing 'brews as a template and use the main [5etools data](https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/TheGiddyLimit.github.io/tree/master/data) as a reference.
- Contributions are welcome. For the Git-literate, make a pull request. For everyone else, create an Issue and post a link to your file (PasteBin is fine), and I (or other maintainers, in future) can add it for you.
