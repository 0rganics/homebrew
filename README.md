Homebrew JSONs compatible with 5etools. An editor will be created eventually.

Getting brew:
1. browse for the file you want
2. click "Raw" (top-right) and save it as .json
3. load into 5etools via the Brew Manager

Getting help:

- Join the [5etools Discord Server](https://discord.gg/v3AXzcW) and ask in the #homebrew channel.

Creating and Contributing:

- The easiest way to make your own, is to copy one of the existing 'brews as a template and/or parts of the main [5etools classes data](https://static.5etools.com/data/classes.json).
- Contributions are welcome. For the Git-literate, make a pull request. For everyone else, create an Issue and post a link to your file (PasteBin is fine), and I (or other maintainers, in future) can add it for you.
