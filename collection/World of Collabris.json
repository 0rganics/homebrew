					"Using various techniques, affected armor takes on the appearance of normal—though sometimes bulky—clothing. Leather padding can be sewn inside canvas tunics and baggy trousers. Chain can be disguised with quilting. Even narrow plates and splinting can be incorporated into the lining of heavy coats.",
					"This modification can apply to most armors suits, excluding half plate and plate. Heavy or medium armor with this addition can be identified with a DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check by anyone within 30 feet. Physically handling any kind of subtle armor reveals its nature without a check. A suit of subtle armor costs twice its normal price."
