When these enemies charge into battle, they call out something that sounds like it might be a name? Maybe capturing one would be a good idea. Question it.

The eldest of them sleep to protect the world\u2014the ones remaining do, at any rate. Mostly I think the chromatics sleep because they know how angry their god would be if they dared to wake.\"",

										"\"There may be other ways.\" Irdizavonax's tendrils stroked his own chin in thought.",
										"\"Can't you...talk into her head?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"Oh of a surety,\" Irdizavonax said. \"But you see we jeweled dragons operate on similar wavelengths. And I am but a lowly wyrmling. Were I to attempt it...attempt it and succeed, she would almost certainly shatter my mind. Nothing personal, you understand.\" Irdy looked with some awe at the eldest sapphire. \"It's just the power of it.\"",

										"Dade smiled and put a hand on her shoulder. \"You don't have to, if you don't want to.\" Had he not, she might have balked. But being condescended to pushed her over the edge. She jerked her shoulder away. \"I want to,\" she said defiantly.",
										"She tuned her lute and stepped forward. She always seemed frightened, frightened by everything, but music made her bold. Given the nature of her weapons, perhaps the boldest of them all. To face the ancient sapphire demigod, armed only with strings and a song.",
										"The song was a trifle. Nothing like the tunes the Riojan in Blackbottom taught her. It was a folk song from home, and it made the children glad and homesick.",
										"Before she could finish the song, a flash of sapphire energy\u2014and a being materialized in mid-stride, walking toward them.",
										"It was short, at least, shorter than Dade. Lithe. Humanoid in form, but otherwise an insect with brilliant, multifaceted eyes. It bore twin rapiers at its hips and wore emerald green armor that reflected light with a liquid sheen, unlike any substance they'd seen before. It reminded them of a beetle's carapace.",
										"Its antennae curled and twitched, sensing arcane forces in the air. It seemed full of cocky confidence and daring.",
										"\"A mantis knight!\" Irdy exclaimed in delight. \"Oh I'd forgotten about them. Well done, old lady.\"",
										"Wenna, Dade, and Jeremy had drawn their weapons. Credan started saying a prayer under his breath. Only Meliora did nothing, except wonder. She was already way ahead of them.",
										"\"This isn't real, is it?\" She could tell by the way it manifested.",
										"\"Very good,\" Irdizavonax said with a slight bow. \"Well, real is, as Orvosortiax taught you, mostly a collection of habits, and by that standard...this creature is very real.\"",
										"The creature stopped before them and bowed, one hand flourishing before it, the opposite leg extended slightly out.",
										"It spoke. Its voice was gay, like birdsong on a spring morning. \"Corovaxinar remembers things that were, things that should have been, and things that might yet be. I am Lady Eweshtleth. I hold the honor of the Gate and the Door.\"",
										"The children stared in rapt attention. Only Irdizavonax was not in awe. \"They're from the Court of...well, now the Court of Arcadia, I suppose,\" he said. \"But once the Mantis Knights were the chief lieutenants of the elves. Still are, I imagine. Somewhere.\"",
										"\"So this a...a memory?\" Meliora asked.",
										"\"Good guess, but I don't think so. Well, maybe. Rather I suspect this is a real person who lived...or will live, displaced chronographically.\"",
										"\"What?\" Several of the children asked.",
										"\"Oh she's from the past, probably. Or the future.\" When none of them spoke, Irdy took it upon himself to impress them with the gravity of the situation. \"This is the power of the Eldest.\"",
										"Meliora looked at the little dragon. Someday...if they succeeded, a million million years from now, Irdy would be like that massive creature slumbering before them. She wondered, privately, if the little dragon would remember them then.",
										"\"Corovaxinar welcomes you,\" the alien insect-woman spoke in a smooth, assured voice. Quite unlike the absentminded old professor they'd gotten used to in Irdy.",
										"Everyone looked to Irdy, but Irdy nodded to Meliora.",
										"\"Oh. Ah. Okay, um...hello. Ah, welcome to...our world.\"",
										"\"A world under siege,\" the Mantis Knight said to Meliora. \"Corovaxinar needs your help.\"",
										"\"We need hers,\" Meliora said.",
										"\"A happy mutuality of purpose,\" the knight said, and bowed its head, smiling.",
										"\"Oh I like her,\" Irdy said, turning to Dade with a smile.",
										"\"Prepare yourselves,\" the knight said, drawing herself up.",
										"\"Um...um for what?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"The War rages. Corovaxinar's projections falter. But you are not projections.\"",
										"\"But we're just...\" Credan gestured from Wenna to Jeremy. \"Kids.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth raised an eyebrow and one antenna twitched. \"Are you now? I think not. You summoned me. You found the hidden fastness of the Eldest when none of your ilk could gain its sanctum.",
										"\"I do not wot of Men. There are none yet, in my time. Or have not been any for millennia. But I deem thee worthy, if any are.\"",
										"\"‘If any are,'\" Jeremy echoed, looking at his older brother. Dade shook his head in disbelief.",
										"\"Besides,\" Lady Eweshtleth said, nodding at the axe on Dade's hip, \"you bear The Edge That Severs Souls. A weapon that would master lesser beings.\"",
										"\"The Soul Carver!\" Irdizavonax exclaimed, taking a step back from Dade. \"Ah yes! Many threads converge. Much that was hidden is now revealed. Hah! And to think I stood with you when you found it. Ahh, to be alive and young in such a time.\"",
										"\"We didn't...\" Dade said, his hand on the pommel of the axe. \"We don't know what that means.\"",
										"\"Yes well don't let that stop you, by all means. You've managed to do pretty well for yourselves knowing not much more than a bunch of farmers' sons and daughters. No reason to change tactics now.\"",
										"\"What...\" Meliora said, taking a step toward the Mantis Knight. \"Where will we be going?\"",
										"The knight cleared her throat, and a portal opened behind her. A swirling, cloudy thing. \"I am the Gate and the Door,\" she said.",
										"\"The door to where?\" Meliora challenged.",
										"\"The World Below,\" Lady Eweshtleth said. The children gasped. They suspected, they feared, but knowing it was another thing altogether.",
										"\"I don't think...\" Credan put a hand on the talisman to St. Gryffyn the Stout. \"I don't think St. Gryffyn can hear me there.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth cocked her head as though listening to a voice, which she was, and nodded. \"Corovaxinar will maintain the portal and act as a conduit. Your saint will hear your prayers.\"",
										"\"What will we find there?\" Meliora asked.",
										"Lady Eweshtleth straightened and assumed a dour persona. \"Horrors,\" she said.",
										"\"How can we face them?\" Wenna asked.",
										"\"As with all things,\" Lady Eweshtleth laughed, her dour demeanor gone. She placed a hand on one elven rapier. \"With song, spell, and steel.\"",
										"She stepped aside and gestured to the portal. Dade and Jeremy looked at each other and then started forward. The others followed.",
										"At the edge of the portal, they stopped and looked behind them. Irdizavonax hadn't moved. Looking very small now, he stood alone.",
										"\"Aren't you coming with us?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"Coming with you? Into that?\" The small topaz dragon nodded at the gate. \"I beg your pardon! Hardly. No, you've already got Corovaxinar on your side\u2014I would be useless. A trifle. Besides, what use is a young sage compared with five stalwart heroes!\" He was teasing them. But he really wasn't going.",
										"Meliora walked back to him. She'd grown and was now a little taller than the topaz wyrmling. \"But we need you,\" she said, her eyes watering.",
										"\"Ah, you like me, and for that am I flattered, lady. But you do not need me. Think back to all you've done. What hand did I play? A humble narrator, little more. It was your actions, your bravery that led you here. All I did was...explain things frankly that I don't think you needed to know.\" \"We'll miss you,\" Meliora said, her voice quiet.",
										"\"Well, I'm not going anywhere,\" Irdizavonax said, looking around the cave. \"I'll be safe as houses here. And I'll be waiting, when you come back.\"",
										"\"Come on,\" Dade said, not unkindly.",
										"Meliora nodded and turned. But Irdizavonax stopped her.",
										"\"Meliora,\" he said, and she turned back.",
										"\"To answer your question,\" Irdy said, walking forward. His voice in her mind was quiet. She knew only she could hear him now. \"I will always remember you,\" Irdizavonax, the topaz wyrmling, said, his wide milky eyes looking up at her in wonder.",
										"Meliora started to cry.",
										"Irdizavonax took a step back and turned his mindspeech back up.",
										"\"Goodbye, tiny humans!\" He waved to them as Meliora joined her friends, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. \"And good luck.\"",
										"The children stepped through the portal. Lady Eweshtleth saluted Irdizavonax with her rapier, and followed.",

						"The Siege of Castle Rend is an adventure for the fifth edition of the world's first roleplaying game, suitable for five 5th-level characters. It takes place over four parts, and each part can be completed in one or two sessions of play, depending on your group's playstyle and how long you like to play in a single sitting. If all goes according to plan over the course of this adventure, the player characters will expose an usurping lord, fight orcs, acquire a stronghold, defend it from an invading army, win the admiration of a town filled with potential vassals, and make political connections within the Barony of Bedegar.",
						"Of course, no adventure goes according to plan. The PCs will invariably throw these well-laid schemes into chaos, and they'll have to improvise.

They basically begin right before the action in this adventure. There are several ways to get a stronghold: a local noble awards one, you buy one, or\u2014perhaps the most common: you clear out a ruin and say, \"Let's make this our base!\" So we use this adventure to show off arguably the most complex iteration of these rules: The players clear out a castle infested with orcs, become embroiled in the local political landscape, and must decide how they're going to use their new stronghold. (Is it a castle with a keep, tower, and temple inside? Or just a huge keep? Not an insignificant question when an enemy army is bearing down on you!)",

I can't wait to run her the next time I deploy this adventure. 😃",
