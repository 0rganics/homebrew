Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.",
					"This is the tale gnoll mothers tell their pups and the story the scourge uses to exhort his troops. Whether it is truth or mere legend, it is easy to see the inspiration for the myth. A gnoll looks much like a humanoid hyena and shares many traits with the animal, including its haunting laughter, and the strength and savagery of these creatures is enough to suggest demonic blood; the typical gnoll band strikes without fear or mercy, tearing into enemies with the fury of fiends incarnate.",
					{
						"type": "entries",
						"name": "Pack Mentality",
						"entries": [
							"In spite of the savage nature of the gnolls, there are some aspects to their culture that are not inherently repulsive. Gnolls place a very strong value on family for instance, respecting blood ties perhaps more than any other aspect of a relationship. Though gnolls within a pack will commonly fight with each other for dominance, these battles are quickly forgotten after their resolution, and in most situations, gnolls of the same bloodline are loyal friends and allies to one another. These bloodlines are almost always traced maternally, through the female line.",
							"This loyalty to family is particularly obvious during combat, either with rival gnoll packs or other races. Gnolls who fight side by side regularly throw away personal glory in order to help their brethren. Perhaps most surprisingly, when a gnoll is separated from their clan and family their instinctive need for such blood ties leads them to form a surrogate \"pack\" from those whom they choose to befriend. To these unlikely allies the gnoll is as loyal and faithful as they would be to their own brothers or sisters, embracing the outsiders as if they were family.",
							"While all gnolls have an innate tendency for collecting souvenirs and trophies, nomadic packs, particularly the savage ones who have little contact with other races except during wartime, find few other ways to acquire technology, having crafted a handful of tools of their own. The result of this is that most gnolls rely on the other races as their source of wealth and technology; which extends to arms and weaponry, giving gnoll armour a unique aesthetic where each suit is typically kitbashed together from scavenged pieces found either on victims or abandoned.",
							"Gnolls of all kinds have an affinity for hyenas, who many see as their brethren and whom they keep as pets or for hunting."
