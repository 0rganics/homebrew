For the duration of this spell, you can regain spell slots as you normally would When you complete this ritual, you regain all spell slots of 3rd level or higher that you didn't regain on your last long rest.  If your deity has abandoned a sphere, either through force or of their own choosing, this spell will fail. The caster will learn from the spell whether their god isn't willing to return to this sphere or if another god is blocking their return to this sphere. Repeated attempts may call unwanted attention upon the caster.",
