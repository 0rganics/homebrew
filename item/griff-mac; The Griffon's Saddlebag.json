One after another, he hurled the great rocks into the city's stone walls, tearing it down further and further with each passing moment.

He was a siege crew all in one creature, and the city lay powerless before him....",

Behind them they carried the same rope once used to lay ruin to the city, but wrapped within it lay the severed head of Hcor'uk, the Colossal.",
