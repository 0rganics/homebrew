Whenever an affected creature that can see you enters the area of this feature or starts its turn within it, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes {@condition frightened} of you. While {@condition frightened} this way, a creature must take the {@action Dash} action and move away from you by the safest route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.",
