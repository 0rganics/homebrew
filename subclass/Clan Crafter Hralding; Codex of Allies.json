At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature within the next 10 minutes, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward. Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect ends immediately if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.",
