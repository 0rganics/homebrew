They are given teeth with which to extract and pulverize bone, corrosive digestive fluids to break down and assimilate it, and the hunger to consume it. How closely a graftling resembles its original race is up to the whim of its creator, but because graftlings are the product of transplantation rather than total reconstruction, there is generally some resemblance. All graftlings end up a perversion of the skeleton.",

Due to their intelligence and reserved disposition, graftlings make practical, less ambitious apprentices. What's more, what was once a miserable pile of assorted bones can now dispose of any unwanted miserable piles of assorted bones. While graftlings often emerge with their intelligence intact, the same cannot always be said for their identity. All find that some part of their past self is invariably corrupted in the process."

Graftlings will avoid fighting for corpses, preferring caution to a meal for which they hunger but do not need.",

They prefer to lead solitary lives. However, this predilection doesn't erase the personality they had in life\u2014provided reanimation didn't do that much.
