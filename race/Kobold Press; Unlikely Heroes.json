					"Deep beneath the earth, the derro wait in twisted cities built by their mad architects. These insane humanoids live, work, and somehow thrive in the lightless depths. They understand the truth about the uncaring gods that dwell between the stars, and they abandoned sanity long ago to save themselves. The derro hide within their insanity in the hope that the dark gods they fear will turn their attention to other, saner races first.",
					"Despite the great distances between their Underdark cities and the surface, derro outposts can be found in the underworld and slums of many cities, both above and below ground. Occasionally, a derro discovers the wider world and finds a path out of the madness.",
					"{@b Pale and Stunted}",
					"The derro are stunted, dwarflike humanoids, small of stature with wide shoulders and stubby limbs. They stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with males only slighter taller than females on average. Their slender builds rarely weigh more than 40 pounds. Their pale skin is nearly translucent, revealing a ghostly web of blue veins. Their large, pure white staring eyes gleam in the dark.",
					"Shorter than surface dwarves, derro are quick and erratic in their movements. Their elaborately braided or styled hair ranges from white to a pale straw color. Males take great pride in their prodigious mustaches, which are often braided and waxed.",
					"{@b History of Madness}",
					"The true history of the derro is an incomprehensible tangle. The entire race is insane, so even when derro keep records, their accounts conflict with each other and with observable reality. The various cults and clans of the derro embrace a wide variety of myths, mostly passed along by oral tradition and mind-bending artwork. Every new teller of a given tale twists or rewrites portions of the story to fit their own warped view of the world.",
					"The derro have existed for ages, perhaps thriving even before the spread of humans across the surface. The more reliable histories of other races agree that the derro have always served the drow as enforcers and slave masters. The drow regard them with a strange type of favor, almost like dim-witted children. The aboleths and duergar have likewise historically used and abused the derro. The derro know no actual friends, but they are overawed by power and dominance. They serve beings whose assumed superiority impresses them.",
					"{@b Culture and Rule}",
					"Love as other races know it is unheard of in the bizarre core family unit of the derro. Derro children are born sane, but they are deliberately driven mad by their relatives, usually by age four. Parents feed, clothe, and protect their children not out of a sense of love or tenderness, but because they know that every derro awakened to the mind-bending truth of their race brings them glory. The horrific rituals that break a young derro’s sanity vary by tribe and even year to year. Details are sparse, but known ritual names include Staring into the Void, Enduring the Heartless Fire, and the First Drink of True Knowledge.",
					"Derro are paranoid, unstable, and jittery, and many suffer powerful delusions of grandeur as well. Madness compels them to commit acts of cruelty against their companions or pets, and these acts ignite constant infighting among them. A few, however, muster enough restraint and control to keep the entirety of derro society from crumbling. Savants are powerful sorcerers who hold their madness at bay long enough to cobble together coherent plans, though even they are dangerously unpredictable. The most powerful leaders are the derro antipaladins. These terrifying engines of crazed destruction have looked deep into the void between stars and survived, and even the savants respect them for that.",
					"{@b Gods of the Derro}",
					"The derro worship a horde of bizarre and terrible beings. Derro ancestral gods such as Addrikah, the Mother of Madness, are common figures of veneration, as are demon lords. Perhaps the most disturbing of their deities are the Great Old Ones whose mere symbolic presence melts minds and corrupts the world. Derro worshipers venerate Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath the Black Goat of the Woods in particular. There is no pattern or reason that governs which dark being will catch a given derro’s fancy, and devotees are violently hostile to worshipers of other entities.",
					"Derro consider themselves the most exalted servants of the blasphemous figures they venerate, the only beings in the entire multiverse who can truly understand their glory. Specific rituals vary from cult to cult, but the unifying thread of derro faith asserts that their racial madness is a gift that makes communion with these deities possible. Further, the derro believe they are the harbingers of the end of time, and that they alone will inherit the shattered husk of creation.",
					"{@b Derro Names}",
					"Names are thrust upon derro children haphazardly and with no clear general customs. Derro who worship an ancestor god might give their children a variation on the exalted figure’s name or title, or a child might grow almost to maturity before any adult bothers to call them by the same jumble of sounds twice. Clan, tribe, and family names also lack any discernable pattern, though occasionally they form a coherent description.",

					"{@b Playing a Derro PC}",
					"Derro are unpredictable, fanciful, and prone to delusions, confusions, and manias. So how can they function in groups more used to the stability of humans, dwarves, and elves?",
					"In truth, the derro are less violent and more peculiar in a quieter way than their common portrayal as rabid maniacs. Among themselves, they are as likely to be brooding, depressed, or sullen as crazed and violent. A derro PC could have a tendency to talk to himself, or might address an invisible friend before undertaking any major step, or might simply consider all the other members of the party as “imaginary friends,” and thus not subject to harassment.",
					"Treat the derro’s madness as an occasional bit of flavor for the character, rather than an excuse to cripple the party with chaotic and self-defeating actions. A derro PC won’t be as predictable as a dwarf paladin or a half-elf bard, but if the other players can cope with a bonestupid half-orc barbarian picking bar fights and that elf rogue picking the ogre’s pockets, they might accept the derro occasionally talking to rocks and interrogating mushrooms. Review the Minor Madnesses section for examples of playable and flavorful maladies.",
					"To avoid derailing the party constantly, the character can have long lucid periods, and might even regret actions taken when “turned to the dark void” or “ridden by the bat spirits” or a similar in-game explanation. The derro in this lucid state could be a tragic character, always wondering when something will set off another bout of irrational raving.",
