					"Bronze automatons are constructed using mechanical and magical techniques that are passed down by the gods. They are built for war and little else. They need constant repairs and maintenance or else they begin to break down. This means that they cannot be left as unattended guardians for longer than a few years.",
					"Constructed Nature. Bronze automatons are the ultimate soldiers. They don't age, and they don't need air, food, drink, or sleep. They are built for the sole purpose of fighting until they are destroyed.",
					"Explosive Power. Bronze automatons are powered by a mixture of elemental fire and bottled lightning. When an automaton is destroyed, this mixture of elemental energy can be released in the automaton's death throes with catastrophic results to anyone standing close to them. Luckily, bronze automatons are immune to lightning and resistant to fire, otherwise these explosions might lead to chain reactions that could obliterate an entire legion of the automatons."
