Great care is therefore given to ensuring that marble golems are displayed in such a way that their beauty is emphasized and respected.",

The golem will become relentless in its desire to track down and kill whoever damaged it. While the golem doesn't have any magical ability to track the object of its hatred, it can follow footprints, and it will interrogate (or destroy) anyone who stands in its way."

They are unfazed by even the most fearsome threats.",

One of her songs dredges up and intensifies a listener's most sorrowful memories, which may break the psyche of those with lesser wills. Another tune lulls a keledone's aggressors into a deep sleep. Depending upon the severity of her victim's transgression, a keledone may continue her somnolent song long enough that her target dies of dehydration.

Many keledone have stood watch for millennia, completely untouched by time. A keledone may be instructed to keep trespassers away using deadly force, while others simply ensure the safety of their charges. Some keledone are tasked with testing adventurers, ensuring that only the strong are able to press on to find the knowledge or treasure that they seek.",

Although it's not an inherent trait, keledone may develop distinct personalities or identities over the course of centuries. This phenomenon occurs most often in keledone who frequently interact with other beings, whether they are other intelligent constructs, supernatural creatures, or mere mortals. Despite their individuality, however, it is exceedingly rare for a keledone to shirk her duties or abandon her post. Those who do find that the magic that sustains them will begin to fade. A disloyal keledone quickly loses her ability to fly, as her heavy metal wings become unable to support the weight of her solid gold frame."

					"Something to Prove. Despite their almost comical appearance, blemys are formidable foes. Underestimating their capabilities can lead to an untimely death. A blemys that does not receive due and proper deference from weaker creatures will demonstrate its giant strength by tearing such disrespectful foes apart. Blemys are frequently assumed to be unintelligent due to their lack of a cranium, and many non-blemys believe, incorrectly, that they are literally brainless. In fact, blemys are the most intelligent type of cyclops. They can outwit the average mortal settler, just as they outwitted their civilized cousins, the gygans, in ages past. The best strategy to avoid conflict with a blemys is to challenge it to a battle of wits. Letting the blemys win and then begging for mercy may be flattering enough for it to spare the loser's life. If a blemys is beaten by an obviously superior intellect, its humiliation will likely drive it to attack in a fit of rage. In such situations, opponents can take advantage of the blemys' limited field of view. If a dexterous and observant individual avoids the blemys' extreme tunnel vision for long enough, then it may be convinced that its quarry has escaped and give up its search in tearful frustration.",
					"Nomadic Lifestyle. Blemys' prickly personalities and antisocial tendencies prevent these creatures from forming communities. They live by raiding poorly-defended settlements for food and other goods, and given the opportunity, they may even steal from their own kindred. As a result, blemys often find themselves wandering alone, as they are quickly driven from an area once survivors of their raids recover and organize.",
					"Uncertain Origins. The origin of these outlandish cyclopes is unknown. Some scholars believe that their condition is a divine curse. Blemys progenitors may have comprised a civilization of particularly intelligent, charismatic, and social cyclopes that were uncharacteristically prone to vanity. This, possibly combined with the nonreligious nature of most cyclopes, attracted the attention of cruel gods who decided to punish them for their pride and narcissism. Robbed of their good looks and affluence, the blemys' civilization quickly collapsed, driving their descendants into lonely lives of perpetual dissatisfaction."

					"Gygans are six-armed giants with a single eye. It is rumored that they are descended from an ancient cyclopean race that was spawned by the gods and thrived millennia ago. Their civilization of city-states competed in great gaming competitions with an emphasis on boxing and wrestling. Sometimes these games could devolve into outright warfare. With the decline of their once great civilization, gygans now live together in small family groups or sometimes alone.",
					"Civilized. Unlike typical cyclopes, gygans echo their once-great civilization in their current lives. Instead of a city-state comprised of a single grand metropolis and the surrounding area, the gygans of today form groups based around a powerful family. A gygan community begins with a grand founder family estate that is built up over time, that attracts solitary gygans and mates from other family groups. These newcomers construct their own homes nearby, creating patches of relatively secure farmland between estates. Gygans within these family groups cooperate to produce food, wine, clothing, art, and entertainment. These self-sustaining communities rarely interact with non-gygans. Consequently, each insular family group develops a distinct culture that may be lost completely if disaster strikes the community. Some gygan family groups have become so isolated that their members speak dialects not intelligible to other speakers of giant or common, including other gygans in the same area.",
					"Superb Athletes. The six arms of a gygan gives it unparalleled athletic prowess. They combine strength with agility and are fearsome warriors due to their ability to use multiple weapons and shields. They can also grapple opponents with their extra arms in order to pin them down before finishing them off."

					"The cyclopes are a primordial race of giants descended from godlike beings. Their ancient ancestors were great soldiers, smiths, and builders. Today, most cyclopes are only a pale reflection of their ancestors. They can vary in size, in intellect, and in the number of arms or fingers that they have, but one feature is always the same\u2014a single great eye under their brow, instead of two.",
					"Descended from Gods. Cyclopes have the blood of gods in their veins. Empyreans are the most common progenitors of the cyclopes, though some cyclopes can claim to be the children of a lesser god that visited the mortal world in the distant past.",
					"Lost Purpose. The cyclopes used to have a greater purpose\u2014to forge weapons to be used by the gods; to guard great treasure vaults filled with doomsday weapons; or to build massive fortresses, towers, and other wondrous architecture. These great tasks have long since been abandoned or forgotten.",
					"Infatuation. Cyclopes often become infatuated with members of the fey races. This infatuation is doomed to end in tragedy, for the fey look upon cyclopes as ugly brutes. The best that a cyclops can hope for is to become a servant, to be used and manipulated.",

					"Foul Tempers. The jancan are known to have foul tempers and an evil disposition. Although they might faithfully serve other cylcopes, they will often play evil tricks on their own kin. They resent the long years they spend crafting fine weapons for stupid brutes.",
					"Legendary Smiths. Jancan are capable of building wondrous weapons due to the nimbleness of their many-fingered hands. They can only forge these items for huge creatures. These items of +1, +2, or +3 quality are bonded to the soul of a single owner and they lose their magical properties when the owner dies.",
